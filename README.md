# 100 Days Of Code

here I will store my notes about what i have learned everyday, It's a challenge for myself too, It's public because I want to see the changes after the 100 days and to inspire myself and other self-taught learners.
the plan will be confusing because there are things I want to learn for my self, things for school and things for completing some tasks.

> opinions are my own

# day 1:

today I was watching AJAX couse from [traversy media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82hnvUYY6QA&t=2976s), he uses an example working with `php` so I wanted to take a quick look at php so I choosed a playlist from [the net ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gksOX3Kd9KPo-O68ncT05o) and a [great repository](https://github.com/odan/learn-php#tutorials)to find other resources.
I already have basic knowledge of programming so I wont take too much time to learn basics of that language (and understand why developers hates it)

## what I've learned

### php (getting started)

- about the syntax php code is written between `<?php` and `?>` like opening and closing tags.
- variables are created by writing `$` symbole (means that php can make you rich in morocco), then the name of the variable and like variables on other languages it can only start with a **character** or **underscore** ex: `$name = "charaf"`
- to create a constant variable you can use `define()` function which takes two _string_ arguments, the first one is the name of the vriables(without the $ in the beginning), and the second one is the value of the variable. `define("NAME", "value")`
- after creating a variable you can use it by calling it's name ex: `$name`, in constnat variable you only need to call the name of the variables ex: `NAME`
- DATA TYPES: `string`, `integers`, `float`, `booleans` etc...
- like `javascript` array are created using `[]` and can contain any kind o data, also php uses 0 based indices.

### adobe xd

- I've learned how to create a UI stylesheet guid
- creating hover effects and playing with some prototypes

### others

- I did some researches about **Kanban**, GitHub Projects, Github PR and issues, and how to work as a scrum master, how to manage my squad, how to convert big topics/problems into small problems and try to solve them together (tbh it's like a boring theory but I've to :[ )
