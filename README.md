# 100 Days Of Code

here I will store my notes about what i have learned everyday, It's a challenge for myself too, It's public because I want to see the changes after the 100 days and to inspire myself and other self-taught learners.
the plan will be confusing because there are things I want to learn for my self, things for school and things for completing some tasks.
> opinions are my own
